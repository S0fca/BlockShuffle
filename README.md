# Block Shuffle
## Minecraft plugin
Coded in IntelliJ IDEA using [Minecraft Development plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development).  

Block shuffle is a minigame in minecraft that you can play with your friends.

The plugin is not my idea, I've seen it online and decided to code it, so that I could learn some basics about coding plugins and play it.
